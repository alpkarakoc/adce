# ADCE — Anomaly Detection & Stochastic Containment Engine

C11 plus one named compiler extension (`__int128`). No external dependencies. Target: lock-free, allocation-free, fail-closed
publication path.

## Commands

- `./scripts/verify.sh` — the gate: strict build + ASan/UBSan + TSan + test run.
  A turn is not finished until all three profiles are green.
- Quick syntax check:
  `cc -std=c11 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Iinclude test/t_adce_platform.c -lpthread`

## Layout

The codebase is no longer a single header. `adce_platform.h` remains header-only — every
platform primitive, the Q16 lane, the RNG and the seqlock are `static inline` in it — but
the Observation Plane has an out-of-line producer, so `src/` exists and both gates compile
it.

- `include/adce_platform.h` — header-only platform layer, built on C11 `stdatomic.h`
  acquire/release. No mutexes, no spinlocks, no allocation.
- `include/adce_observe.h` — Observation Plane types, the single tuning-constant block
  (T, N, z_lo, z_hi, alpha, the sigma epsilon, the warmup length), and the inline
  per-arrival tap. Pure functions on the publication path — squash and clamp — are inline
  here so the tests reach them without a running observer. `sigma` comes from libm's
  `sqrt`; both gates link `-lm`, and the fail-closed handling sits in the epsilon floor in
  `adce_obs_epoch_close`, written as `!(sigma >= EPS)` so one comparison covers NaN,
  negative and zero.
- `src/adce_observe.c` — Observation Plane producer, off the arrival path: `adce_obs_init`,
  `adce_obs_claim_writer`, `adce_obs_epoch_close`.
- `test/t_adce_platform.c` — owns `main()` and the single runner table. `t_*` unit tests:
  Q16.16 arithmetic (including overflow), token-bucket clamping, RNG sanity, time
  monotonicity, single-threaded seqlock, and a two-thread stress test.
- `test/t_adce_observe.c` — Observation Plane cases. Each is `static`, so the gate's
  ran-tests guard finds it by source pattern, and each has one external forwarder that the
  runner table in `t_adce_platform.c` registers.

## Locked decisions — do not change without stating a reason

- Shipping target is Linux x86_64. Local development target is the host architecture,
  because ARM64's weak memory model is a stricter test of the seqlock than x86_64's TSO.
  Code that passes on ARM64 passes on x86_64; the reverse does not hold.
- `adce_epoch_state_t`: sequence + pressure (Q16.16) + epoch_id + observed_at_ns,
  padded and aligned to exactly one `ADCE_CACHELINE`, fixed by `_Static_assert`.
  `ADCE_CACHELINE` is 64 on x86_64 and 128 on arm64.
- `_Alignas` is applied to the first member, never to the typedef (C11 §6.7.5p2).
  This broke the first build; keep it that way.
- `adce_epoch_publish` / `adce_epoch_read` / `adce_epoch_is_stale` implement the
  publish/consume + fail-closed watchdog pattern.
- Time source is `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` only.
- Platform-specific primitives (CPU pause, entropy) live behind `ADCE_*` macros in one
  block at the top of the header. Nothing else in the codebase is arch-conditional.

## Working agreement

- No placeholders. `// TODO`, stub returns, and empty bodies are defects, not drafts.
- Never silence a warning; fix its cause. `-Werror` is not removed and sanitizer
  suppression files are not written.
- Read before you write. Never assume a symbol exists — grep for it.
- Present changes as diffs or complete file overrides.
- If a request violates a locked decision above, halt, state the risk, and propose the
  corrected design before writing code.
- `scripts/verify.sh` and the files under `scripts/hooks/` are the verification gate.
  Never modify them in the same commit as the code they check. A gate change is proposed
  first, with its reason, and lands in its own commit.
- `adce_rng_seed` calls `abort()` when the entropy draw fails. A PRNG seeded from a
  failed or partial draw is predictable and every downstream containment decision
  inherits that, so there is deliberately no degraded seeding path.
- Changing a public function's signature, return contract, or failure behaviour is an
  API decision. Propose it and wait for confirmation; never fold it into a step whose
  stated scope was something else.
- `__int128` / `unsigned __int128` is a deliberate, load-bearing compiler extension, not
  an oversight. `adce_q16_mul`, `adce_q16_div`, and the token bucket all need a width
  above 64 bits, and `ADCE_Q16_MAX` is `INT64_MAX`, so a 16-bit left shift of a full-range
  numerator does not fit in `int64_t`. The dependency is made explicit by the `#error`
  guard at the top of the header. Do not "clean it up" — it cannot be removed without
  narrowing the Q16 lane, which is a separate design decision.
- The shipping target builds and its tests pass under GCC 14 on linux/arm64 and
  linux/amd64 (`scripts/verify-linux-gcc.sh`). GCC's `__int128` pedwarn under `-pedantic`
  is resolved by `__extension__` on the two typedefs, with every use routed through them:
  the diagnostic fires on bare casts too, so annotating declarations alone would not have
  covered it. `-pedantic` is intact.
- Verified on real x86_64: GitHub Actions run 33742877639, green on the first attempt.
  Runner `ubuntu-24.04`, Linux 6.17.0-1022-azure x86_64, 2 vCPU AT THE TIME OF THAT RUN --
  the standard runners were widened to 4 vCPU later the same day, as recorded below; this
  line is the record of one run, not a standing property of the label. All three `verify.sh`
  profiles — strict, ASan+UBSan, TSan — executed natively under `Ubuntu clang version
  18.1.3 (1ubuntu1)`, and `verify-linux-gcc.sh`'s linux/amd64 leg ran natively under
  `gcc (GCC) 14.4.0`. The `ADCE_CACHELINE == 64` branch, `__builtin_ia32_pause` and the
  64-byte `_Static_assert`s have therefore now been RUN under sanitizers on the shipping
  architecture rather than only compiled for it. LeakSanitizer executed for the first time
  in this project's history — `verify.sh` enables it only on Linux, and Darwin has no LSan
  back end — and reported nothing; neither did UBSan or TSan.
- GCC's sanitizers now run too, and agree with Clang's. Run 33746269305: `gcc (GCC) 14.4.0`
  ASan+UBSan on `verify-linux-gcc.sh`'s linux/amd64 leg, native x86_64, all 30 cases green
  and not one diagnostic — no `runtime error`, no `SUMMARY:`, no leak report. That matters
  for two specific places rather than in general: `adce_obs_clamp_record` cites UBSan by
  name as the check that catches its `ADCE_Q16_MIN` negation guard, and the `__int128` Q16
  lane rests on the same check. Both are now two-compiler evidence instead of one
  compiler's opinion. The profile is conditional by construction — amd64 only, and only
  where amd64 is native — and it prints a loud SKIP with its reason everywhere else, so
  "GCC's sanitizers passed" and "GCC's sanitizers were not run here" can never be confused.
- This does NOT retire the arm64 evidence, and reading it that way inverts the argument.
  x86_64 is TSO and is the weaker test; arm64's weak ordering is what can expose a missing
  barrier, which is why the local target is the host architecture. What changed is which
  leg is unattended: arm64 native TSan now runs only on a developer machine, because no CI
  job runs on arm64 hardware at all — the linux/arm64 leg is qemu under an x86_64 host.
- arm64 now runs on CI hardware, not just a laptop. `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, Linux
  6.17.0-1022-azure aarch64, all three `verify.sh` profiles under `Ubuntu clang
  version 18.1.3 (1ubuntu1)`, TSan included and silent. It was 2 vCPU when this was
  written and is 4 vCPU now — GitHub widened the standard runners on 2026-09-03, between
  runs 33748879974 (11:17 UTC, `nproc: 2`) and 33750562868 (11:36 UTC, `nproc: 4`). The
  count is recorded per run rather than as a property of the runner label, because it has
  already changed once underneath a claim that named it. Both runners carry the same clang,
  so a future divergence between them is attributable to the machine rather than to the
  toolchain — which is the only reason the comparison is worth anything.
- What that run actually taught, and what an architecture-only evidence list hides: CORE
  COUNT was the discriminating variable, not architecture. A phase-transition race in the
  harness survived four green runs — the development laptop and three 2-core CI runs — and
  surfaced only when a 2-core runner stretched the window between a store and another
  thread observing it (run 33748342781, `nproc: 2` on both legs). It appeared in the strict
  `-O2` profile, not under a sanitizer, because ASan and TSan dilate execution and mask
  exactly this class, and TSan cannot see a logical race at all. So "ran on arm64 and on
  x86_64" is a weaker statement than it looks.

  The strongest single piece of evidence for that is in the failing run itself and was not
  previously written down: the leg that FAILED was `ubuntu-24.04`, x86_64, while
  `ubuntu-24.04-arm` passed in the same run, on the same commit, at the same core count.
  The weaker memory model is the one that broke. That is as clean a separation of core
  count from architecture as this project is going to get, and it also explains why TSO
  offered no protection — a phase-accounting race is a logical race, so no amount of store
  ordering constrains it. Repeated execution under varied scheduling
  is what finds these, which is why the scheduled run exists and why `ADCE_REPEAT` does.
- The development machine is 8 logical cores, not 4: an Apple M3, 4 performance plus 4
  efficiency. The earlier "4-core laptop" named one cluster and read as the whole machine.
  Neither number is the timing regime, and that is the point worth recording. macOS places
  threads by QoS class and migrates them between clusters; this project sets no QoS, and
  Apple Silicon exposes no CPU affinity to pin with, so how many of the harness's threads
  run simultaneously and on which cluster is neither observable from the test nor stable
  between runs. The two clusters differ in clock and microarchitecture, so the
  store-to-observation window differs by placement. **The effective concurrency of the
  local gate is therefore not known.** That is the reason CI evidence outranks laptop
  evidence here despite the laptop being the faster machine: `nproc` on a runner is a
  uniform hard bound, and the laptop's number is not a bound at all.
- The 2-core hardware that found the race is gone, and this must not be read as if it were
  still there. Both runners report `nproc: 4` as of 2026-09-03 11:36 UTC. The claim "no CI
  job has ever run this code on more than two cores" was true when written and is now
  false; every run from 33750562868 onward is 4-core, including the 30-execution
  `ADCE_REPEAT=10` dispatch 33771710873.

  Does that weaken the nightly? **No — it changes what the nightly hunts, and separately it
  invalidates the arithmetic that chose 10.** Taking those in order.

  The phase race needed a thread descheduled between a store and another thread's
  observation. That happens when runnable threads outnumber cores, so a 2-core runner
  produced it readily. At 4 cores the harness's threads more often run genuinely
  simultaneously, and preemption-induced windows narrow: the specific mechanism that found
  that bug is now LESS likely per execution. But true simultaneity is the stronger test for
  the other class — a missing barrier on weakly-ordered arm64 needs two threads executing
  at the same instant, and heavy preemption on two cores can mask it by serialising them.
  The matrix has traded preemption-window coverage for true-parallelism coverage. Neither
  direction is strictly better and the nightly is worth keeping; what is no longer true is
  that it hunts the same thing it was built to hunt.

  The arithmetic is the concrete loss. `ADCE_REPEAT=10` was derived in 25c0e6b from
  p ~ 0.067 per execution — roughly 15 harness executions on 2-core CI with one failure —
  giving ~87% detection per night. That p was measured on hardware no longer in the matrix,
  there is no equivalent measurement at 4 cores, and the bug is fixed so p cannot be
  re-measured. **Read 10 as a round number until something re-derives it.** The honest
  summary is that this project can no longer reproduce the only timing bug it has ever
  found. Restoring that coverage means constraining parallelism deliberately — running the
  strict profile under `taskset -c 0,1` or an equivalent — rather than relying on the
  runner being small. That is a gate change and belongs in its own commit with its own
  reason; it is not done here.
- Still unverified, in descending order of how much each would change a decision.
  (1) GCC's TSan runs nowhere; the GCC profile above is ASan+UBSan only, deliberately, so
  every race result in this project is Clang's. (2) The Darwin half of
  `adce_platform_get_entropy` — the `getentropy` chunking loop — has no automated coverage
  at all: CI is Linux-only and takes the `getrandom` branch, so that code runs only on the
  development machine. No CI job runs macOS, which is the platform the per-edit gate runs
  on. (3) Closed-loop behaviour — oscillation, settling, limit cycles — has no load model
  and no evidence in either direction. (4) Per-arrival latency under CONTENTION.
  §5 of `docs/enforcement-plane.md` now carries the measurement — both architectures, per
  outcome, with the method — so the gate's cost is no longer an open question. What is
  still open is that every one of those figures comes from a fixture with no concurrent
  publication: `adce_epoch_read` never retried, so the seqlock's retry path has never been
  timed and §2's estimate of those odds remains analytic. Separately, and by
  design rather than by omission: the `abort()` in `adce_rng_seed` has never executed, and
  cannot without fault injection.
- `adce_q16_div` with a zero divisor saturates toward the numerator's sign: negative
  numerator yields `ADCE_Q16_MIN`, zero or positive yields `ADCE_Q16_MAX`. A collapsed
  divisor therefore reads as maximal pressure downstream, never as zero. `0 / 0` is
  `ADCE_Q16_MAX` by this rule. This is a fail-closed contract; changing it is an API
  decision.
- A FUTURE `observed_at_ns` reads as maximally stale, and the unsigned wrap in
  `adce_epoch_is_stale` is what produces it. A reader that cannot order the publication it
  read against the clock it read has no coherent view of time and must not act on that
  publication, so the wrap is load-bearing rather than an oversight: replacing it with a
  signed difference, a saturating guard, or an `observed_at_ns > now_ns` branch returning 0
  turns the case fail-OPEN. A torn `adce_epoch_read` counts as stale for the same reason —
  no snapshot means no advice. Both are reachable without any fault and both require a
  concurrent publication, so nonzero `stale_reads` on a healthy system is expected. Full
  statement in `adce_platform.h` above `adce_epoch_is_stale` and in
  `docs/enforcement-plane.md` §4.1, with the measurements. This is a fail-closed contract;
  changing it is an API decision.
- Rounding is toward negative infinity across the whole Q16 lane. `adce_q16_to_int`
  floors via its arithmetic right shift, and `adce_q16_div` floors by stepping the
  truncated quotient down when the remainder is non-zero and the operand signs differ.
  Truncation toward zero was the earlier behaviour and left a dead band two LSBs wide
  around zero, where the quantization step doubles — a pressure signal driving threshold
  crossings behaves differently there than anywhere else in its range. Flooring is
  uniform. This is a contract; changing it, or changing one function without the other,
  is an API decision.
