# ADCE — Anomaly Detection & Stochastic Containment Engine

Pure C11. No external dependencies. Target: lock-free, allocation-free, fail-closed
publication path.

## Commands

- `./scripts/verify.sh` — the gate: strict build + ASan/UBSan + TSan + test run.
  A turn is not finished until all three profiles are green.
- Quick syntax check:
  `cc -std=c11 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Iinclude test/t_adce_platform.c -lpthread`

## Layout

- `include/adce_platform.h` — single header, built on C11 `stdatomic.h` acquire/release.
  No mutexes, no spinlocks, no allocation.
- `test/t_adce_platform.c` — `t_*` unit tests: Q16.16 arithmetic (including overflow),
  token-bucket clamping, RNG sanity, time monotonicity, single-threaded seqlock, and a
  two-thread stress test.

## Locked decisions — do not change without stating a reason

- Shipping target is Linux x86_64. Local development target is the host architecture,
  because ARM64's weak memory model is a stricter test of the seqlock than x86_64's TSO.
  Code that passes on ARM64 passes on x86_64; the reverse does not hold.
- `adce_epoch_state_t`: sequence + pressure (Q16.16) + epoch_id + observed_at_ns,
  padded and aligned to exactly one `ADCE_CACHELINE`, fixed by `_Static_assert`.
  `ADCE_CACHELINE` is 64 on x86_64 and 128 on arm64.
- `_Alignas` is applied to the first member, never to the typedef (C11 §6.7.5p2).
  This broke the first build; keep it that way.
- `adce_epoch_publish` / `adce_epoch_read` / `adce_epoch_is_stale` implement the
  publish/consume + fail-closed watchdog pattern.
- Time source is `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` only.
- Platform-specific primitives (CPU pause, entropy) live behind `ADCE_*` macros in one
  block at the top of the header. Nothing else in the codebase is arch-conditional.

## Working agreement

- No placeholders. `// TODO`, stub returns, and empty bodies are defects, not drafts.
- Never silence a warning; fix its cause. `-Werror` is not removed and sanitizer
  suppression files are not written.
- Read before you write. Never assume a symbol exists — grep for it.
- Present changes as diffs or complete file overrides.
- If a request violates a locked decision above, halt, state the risk, and propose the
  corrected design before writing code.
